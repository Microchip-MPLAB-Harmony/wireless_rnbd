#  Microchip MPLAB Harmony RNBD/RN487x BLE Library

MPLAB Harmony [RNBD](http://mchpweb:4576/SpecIndex_FileAttach/TPT_20227216811993/70005514A.pdf)/[RN487x](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/RN4870) BLE Modules Library allows quick and easy configuration of the <br /> code generated software driver based upon the user’s selected API features available<br /> from the MCC Library. Generated Driver code supports use of either BLE Module with use<br /> of a 32 Bit PIC Devices.

The library module uses a Graphic User Interface \(GUI\) presented by MCC within MPLABX<br /> which allows for selection of desired configuration, and custom configurations of the<br /> protocol. Customized C code is generated within the MPLABX project, in a folder named<br /> "MCC Generated Files".

MPLAB Harmony 3 is an extension of the MPLAB� ecosystem for creating
embedded firmware solutions for Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC microcontroller
and microprocessor devices.  Refer to the following links for more information.
